## üöß **Limitations**
‚Ä¢	**No AWS Service Reference:**

This tool does not cross-reference the Actions, Resources, and Condition keys with the AWS Service Authorization Reference (AWS Service Reference Documentation).

‚Ä¢	**Deeply Nested Structures:**

Complex, deeply nested policy elements may not be fully parsed or explained.

‚Ä¢	**Custom Condition Keys:**

The tool may not provide a detailed explanation for custom-defined condition keys outside of AWS‚Äôs standard keys.

‚Ä¢	**Valid JSON Only:**

The tool requires a correctly formatted JSON policy to work. Incorrect JSON will result in an error.
